Hello! 
Thank you for grading my program!

Important Notice
------------------
In some customer GUIs, certain fields are intentionally non-editable. This is based on guidelines from our professor, who advised that only logically editable fields should be user-modifiable.
For example, in the AccountDetail GUI, users can change the account type but cannot edit the balance, creation date, overdraft, interest rate, or name. These fields are controlled by the bank.
If you encounter any data that you cannot edit, please note that this is intentional and not an oversight.
